finished:
raytracer.cpp: rayfraction, reflection
light.cpp: distance attenuation, shadow Attenuation(blocked if intersect any surface(directional)(before light source for point))
trimesh.cpp: intersection(compute bary and t)

graphicalUI.cpp: threading

anti-aliasing

tested: mostly works except it's much brighter than sample solution in box.ray and box_map1.bmp(try different distance attenuation)

material.cpp:   TextureMap::getMappedValue

fixed key bug: in trimesh.cpp,  t < epsilon instead of t<0

to-do:

accelaration 

adaptive sampling

trimesh 1(barycentric material),2,3

light.cpp: shadowAttenuation(multiply transparency of any surface encountered(before the point light))

trimesh.cpp: set uv, and set material to be bary?

change UI supersampling to 1 4 9 16
